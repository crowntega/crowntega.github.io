		<p>I am looking to be an entrepreneur because I would like to make a positive impact in Nigeria. Though I would like to establish a company in Nigeria, I am really looking to make waves in the international markets.  My moment of obligation comes from my struggles growing up in Nigeria as well as wanting to better the lives of my family.  We are well to do but as the oldest child, I feel obligated to have begun to start supporting my family at this time.</p>

		<p>Finally, I am emotionally intelligent. I am a good team player and love to be prepared. I am a good orator and love working with deadlines. What does it take to be an entrepreneur? I believe it is having an idea that appeals to the masses. I am an entrepreneur because I had an idea and ran with it. It is something that had value in the Nigerian market. I plan to extend the life of the business by introducing merchandise</p>

		<p>I have experienced a lot of set backs and failure in my entrepreneurial journey. I tried to reach out to several heads of companies working for fast food or cinema companies (such as KFC, Chicken Republic, Silverbird Cinemas and even many local convenience stories) and was unable to sell my brand or even strike a deal. Eventually, I had to settle for Jumia, a popular e commerce website in Nigeria, similar to Amazon. I am hoping Mest will assist me in tapping into the unventured regions of my creativity. I want to learn to be a strong negotiator and learn to be a but more independent for those times I find myself in a financial glut.</p>

	<p>I am at Mest to receive Masters level knowledge in business, enhance my software development skills, learn other programming languages, found an innovative disruption from Nigeria with focus on global solutions, mentorship and funding. Mest is the first and only company who can offer these freely.</p>

	<p>

<li> Passion

By constantly trying to shape and refine my end goals. I could do this by asking my mates about their vision, asking people to analyze what they think of who Stephanie is, and putting into action the things I learn in class </li>
<br>

<li>Opportunistic

By taking advantage of events held at MEST such as the Hackathons, taking advantage of business/entrepreneurial related seminars held around Ghana, asking more questions during and outside of class, interviewing MEST alums, networking with my classmates and guest speakers and reading goal related material outside of class.</li>
<br>

<li>Courage

By doing the things that one normally won't see me do such as attending social gatherings and approaching people.</li>
<br>

<li>Inspirational

By planning to give more; I will spend time helping out by spending my time or sharing my knowledge to the less fortunate in charity homes.</li>
<br>

By going the extra mile, studying harder, working on my focus and self discipline when things become challenging; for example, not understand a topic, when things get boring, or are not going my way.</li></p>
